# Share XR ‚Äî Collaborative Mixed Reality

A revolutionary mixed reality platform that enables multiple users to collaborate in shared virtual spaces with real-time synchronization of anchors, object manipulation, and spatial interactions.

*Multiple users collaborating in a shared mixed reality environment*

## Project Overview

Share XR breaks down the barriers of remote collaboration by creating persistent, shared mixed reality environments where teams can work together as if they were in the same physical space. The platform synchronizes spatial anchors, 3D objects, and user interactions across multiple devices in real-time.

The system leverages cutting-edge spatial computing technologies to create seamless collaborative experiences that feel natural and intuitive. Users can manipulate virtual objects, draw in 3D space, and share digital content as if they were physically present in the same room.

*Real-time object manipulation and spatial anchor synchronization*

## Key Features

### üåê Real-time Synchronization
- **Spatial Anchors**: Persistent world-locked positions shared across all users
- **Object Manipulation**: Real-time updates when users move, rotate, or scale objects
- **Gesture Recognition**: Hand tracking and gesture synchronization
- **Voice Communication**: Spatial audio with 3D positioning

The synchronization system ensures that all users see the same virtual content in the same physical locations, creating a truly shared experience. Advanced prediction algorithms minimize latency and provide smooth interactions even over network connections.

- **Model Review**: Import and collaboratively examine 3D models
- **Presentation Mode**: Share screens and documents in virtual space
- **Recording & Playback**: Capture and replay collaboration sessions

## Technical Architecture

The Share XR platform is built on a robust, scalable architecture designed to handle real-time collaboration across multiple devices and platforms. Our custom networking layer ensures low-latency communication while maintaining data consistency across all connected clients.

### Networking Layer
```csharp
// Real-time synchronization using Photon PUN2
public class ShareXRNetworkManager : MonoBehaviourPunPV
{
    [PunRPC]
    void SyncAnchor(string anchorId, Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation)
    {
        // Synchronize spatial anchors across all clients
        AnchorManager.Instance.UpdateSharedAnchor(anchorId, position, rotation);
    }
    
    [PunRPC]
    void SyncObjectTransform(string objectId, Vector3 pos, Quaternion rot, Vector3 scale)
    {
        // Real-time object manipulation sync
        SharedObjectManager.Instance.UpdateObject(objectId, pos, rot, scale);
    }
}
```

### Spatial Computing
- **World Mapping**: Persistent spatial understanding across sessions
- **Occlusion Handling**: Real-world object occlusion of virtual content
- **Physics Simulation**: Shared physics state across all clients
- **Lighting Estimation**: Dynamic lighting adaptation

Our spatial computing engine creates detailed maps of physical environments, allowing virtual content to interact realistically with real-world surfaces and objects. This creates convincing mixed reality experiences where digital and physical elements coexist naturally.

### Performance Optimizations
- **Level of Detail (LOD)**: Dynamic quality adjustment based on distance
- **Culling Systems**: Frustum and occlusion culling for performance
- **Network Compression**: Optimized data transmission
- **Predictive Tracking**: Smooth interpolation for low-latency experience

    private Dictionary<string, CloudSpatialAnchor> cloudAnchors;
    
    public async Task<bool> CreateSharedAnchor(Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation)
    {
        // Create local anchor
        var localAnchor = CreateLocalAnchor(position, rotation);
        
        // Upload to cloud
        var cloudAnchor = await UploadToCloud(localAnchor);
        
        // Share with other users
        photonView.RPC("ShareAnchorId", RpcTarget.Others, cloudAnchor.Identifier);
        
        return cloudAnchor != null;
    }
}
```
