# Share XR ‚Äî Collaborative Mixed Reality

A revolutionary mixed reality platform that enables multiple users to collaborate in shared virtual spaces with real-time synchronization of anchors, object manipulation, and spatial interactions.

## Project Overview

Share XR breaks down the barriers of remote collaboration by creating persistent, shared mixed reality environments where teams can work together as if they were in the same physical space. The platform synchronizes spatial anchors, 3D objects, and user interactions across multiple devices in real-time.

## Key Features

### üåê Real-time Synchronization
- **Spatial Anchors**: Persistent world-locked positions shared across all users
- **Object Manipulation**: Real-time updates when users move, rotate, or scale objects
- **Gesture Recognition**: Hand tracking and gesture synchronization
- **Voice Communication**: Spatial audio with 3D positioning

### üîó Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **HoloLens 2**: Native mixed reality experience
- **Magic Leap**: Optimized for Magic Leap devices
- **Mobile AR**: iOS and Android support via ARCore/ARKit
- **VR Headsets**: Oculus, Vive, and other OpenXR compatible devices

### üéØ Collaborative Tools
- **3D Whiteboarding**: Draw and annotate in 3D space
- **Model Review**: Import and collaboratively examine 3D models
- **Presentation Mode**: Share screens and documents in virtual space
- **Recording & Playback**: Capture and replay collaboration sessions

## Technical Architecture

### Networking Layer
```csharp
// Real-time synchronization using Photon PUN2
public class ShareXRNetworkManager : MonoBehaviourPunPV
{
    [PunRPC]
    void SyncAnchor(string anchorId, Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation)
    {
        // Synchronize spatial anchors across all clients
        AnchorManager.Instance.UpdateSharedAnchor(anchorId, position, rotation);
    }
    
    [PunRPC]
    void SyncObjectTransform(string objectId, Vector3 pos, Quaternion rot, Vector3 scale)
    {
        // Real-time object manipulation sync
        SharedObjectManager.Instance.UpdateObject(objectId, pos, rot, scale);
    }
}
```

### Spatial Computing
- **World Mapping**: Persistent spatial understanding across sessions
- **Occlusion Handling**: Real-world object occlusion of virtual content
- **Physics Simulation**: Shared physics state across all clients
- **Lighting Estimation**: Dynamic lighting adaptation

### Performance Optimizations
- **Level of Detail (LOD)**: Dynamic quality adjustment based on distance
- **Culling Systems**: Frustum and occlusion culling for performance
- **Network Compression**: Optimized data transmission
- **Predictive Tracking**: Smooth interpolation for low-latency experience

## Use Cases

## Implementation Highlights

### Anchor Persistence System
```csharp
public class PersistentAnchorSystem : MonoBehaviour
{
    private Dictionary<string, CloudSpatialAnchor> cloudAnchors;
    
    public async Task<bool> CreateSharedAnchor(Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation)
    {
        // Create local anchor
        var localAnchor = CreateLocalAnchor(position, rotation);
        
        // Upload to cloud
        var cloudAnchor = await UploadToCloud(localAnchor);
        
        // Share with other users
        photonView.RPC("ShareAnchorId", RpcTarget.Others, cloudAnchor.Identifier);
        
        return cloudAnchor != null;
    }
}
```

### Real-time Object Synchronization
- **Delta Compression**: Only send changed properties
- **Interpolation**: Smooth movement between network updates
- **Ownership Transfer**: Dynamic object ownership management
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle simultaneous manipulations
