## Technical Architecture

### Unity VR Framework
Built on Unity 2022.3 LTS with the XR Interaction Toolkit:

```csharp
public class SurgicalTool : XRGrabInteractable
{
    [SerializeField] private HapticFeedbackController haptics;
    [SerializeField] private ToolType toolType;
    [SerializeField] private float cuttingForce = 10f;
    
    protected override void OnSelectEntered(SelectEnterEventArgs args)
    {
        base.OnSelectEntered(args);
        haptics.StartToolFeedback(toolType);
        AnalyticsManager.Instance.LogToolPickup(toolType);
    }
    
    private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
        if (other.CompareTag("Tissue"))
        {
            TissueInteraction tissue = other.GetComponent<TissueInteraction>();
            if (tissue.CanCut(toolType))
            {
                PerformCut(tissue);
                haptics.TriggerCuttingFeedback(cuttingForce);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Haptic Integration
Integrated with Ultraleap hand tracking and force feedback devices:

```csharp
public class HapticFeedbackController : MonoBehaviour
{
    private HapticDevice leftDevice;
    private HapticDevice rightDevice;
    
    public void TriggerCuttingFeedback(float intensity)
    {
        Vector3 forceVector = CalculateResistanceForce(intensity);
        
        if (IsLeftHandActive())
            leftDevice.SendForce(forceVector);
        else
            rightDevice.SendForce(forceVector);
            
        // Add vibration for texture feedback
        StartCoroutine(TextureVibration(0.2f));
    }
    
    private Vector3 CalculateResistanceForce(float intensity)
    {
        // Physics-based force calculation
        Vector3 toolVelocity = GetToolVelocity();
        Vector3 resistance = -toolVelocity.normalized * intensity;
        return Vector3.ClampMagnitude(resistance, maxForce);
    }
}
```

### Anatomical Modeling
High-fidelity 3D models with deformable tissues:

```csharp
public class DeformableTissue : MonoBehaviour
{
    private Mesh originalMesh;
    private Vector3[] originalVertices;
    private Vector3[] deformedVertices;
    
    [SerializeField] private float elasticity = 0.8f;
    [SerializeField] private float damping = 0.1f;
    
    public void ApplyDeformation(Vector3 point, float force, float radius)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < originalVertices.Length; i++)
        {
            float distance = Vector3.Distance(originalVertices[i], point);
            
            if (distance < radius)
            {
                float influence = 1f - (distance / radius);
                Vector3 deformation = (point - originalVertices[i]) * force * influence;
                
                deformedVertices[i] = Vector3.Lerp(
                    deformedVertices[i],
                    originalVertices[i] + deformation,
                    Time.deltaTime * elasticity
                );
            }
        }
        
        UpdateMesh();
    }
}
```

## Advanced Features

### AI-Powered Assessment
Machine learning models evaluate student performance:

```csharp
public class PerformanceEvaluator : MonoBehaviour
{
    private MLModel assessmentModel;
    private List<MotionData> recordedMotions;
    
    public async Task<AssessmentResult> EvaluatePerformance()
    {
        // Prepare input data
        float[] inputFeatures = ExtractFeatures(recordedMotions);
        
        // Run ML inference
        var prediction = await assessmentModel.PredictAsync(inputFeatures);
        
        return new AssessmentResult
        {
            OverallScore = prediction.Score,
            TechnicalSkill = prediction.TechnicalRating,
            Efficiency = prediction.EfficiencyRating,
            SafetyCompliance = prediction.SafetyRating,
            Recommendations = GenerateRecommendations(prediction)
        };
    }
    
    private float[] ExtractFeatures(List<MotionData> motions)
    {
        return new float[]
        {
            CalculateHandSteadiness(motions),
            MeasureToolPrecision(motions),
            EvaluateMovementEfficiency(motions),
            AssessTimeManagement(motions)
        };
    }
}
```

### Multiplayer Collaboration
Multiple users can participate in the same procedure:

```csharp
public class MultiplayerManager : NetworkBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private Transform[] playerSpawnPoints;
    private Dictionary<ulong, PlayerRole> playerRoles;
    
    [ServerRpc]
    public void AssignRoleServerRpc(ulong clientId, PlayerRole role)
    {
        playerRoles[clientId] = role;
        UpdatePlayerUIClientRpc(clientId, role);
    }
    
    [ClientRpc]
    private void SynchronizeProcedureStateClientRpc(ProcedureState state)
    {
        // Update all clients with current procedure progress
